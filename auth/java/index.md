## Initializing auth service

By using WeDeploy API client you can initialize the authentication service by referencing its URL, like in the example below.

```js
WeDeploy.auth('http://<containerID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.me');
```

After initializing the authentication service URL, WeDeploy client stores its information for future calls.

Note that if you are initializing an auth service pointing to the Cloud you should use the proper domain:

```js
WeDeploy.auth('http://<containerID>.<projectID>.wedeploy.io');
```
